% FSA on human face data
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% This dataset contains grayscale images of 38 individuals and around 64 near frontal images under different illuminations per individual. The faces are processed so that they are cropped and centered, with 32 x 32 pixels each.

load YaleB_32x32.mat

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Scale the features (pixel values) to [0,1]
maxValue = max(max(fea));
fea = fea/maxValue;
%===========================================

% plot 100 first images all togeter in one figure
faceW = 32;
faceH = 32;
numPerLine = 10;
ShowLine = 10;

Y = zeros(faceH*ShowLine,faceW*numPerLine);
for i=0:ShowLine-1
   for j=0:numPerLine-1
     Y(i*faceH+1:(i+1)*faceH,j*faceW+1:(j+1)*faceW) = reshape(fea(i*numPerLine+j+1,:),[faceH,faceW]);
   end
end

figure;
imagesc(Y);
colormap(gray);

% example of a plot (just the first face) 
figure;
Y1=reshape(fea(1,:),[faceH,faceW]);
imagesc(Y1);
colormap(gray);

% plot the same figure but in 1-D
figure;
plot(fea(1,:));
title('first face in 1-D');
